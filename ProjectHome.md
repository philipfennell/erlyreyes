# E-Reyes #

An experimental implementation of the [Reyes Image Rendering Architecture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reyes_rendering) as used in Pixar's [RenderManÂ®](https://renderman.pixar.com/).

This project aims to explore the advantages of [Functional Programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_Programming) allied with the [Concurrent Programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_(programming)) features of [Erlang](http://www.erlang.org/) that lend themselves well to some of the key features of the Reyes architecture.
